intro: |
  I am an engineer with 2 years experience working in technology. I have primarily worked on the JVM, but have worked across a broad range of technologies thereon: PHP,and most recently Java. As well as spending a reasonable amount of time building applications for the web, which has given me an exposure to a range of javascript technologies over the years, through jQuery,backbone and most recently to React. <br/><br/>
  I enjoy building interesting applications, with a good Applicaiton Management focus and a good emphasis on good engineering principles and clean code implementing design patterns.<br/><br/>
  I have worked in small scale consultancy roles across ODisha,India as well as a mix of startup experience (including one that was acquired) and I was been the Junior Software Intern at a tech startup called <a href="https://www.tetralance.com/" target="_blank">Tetralance Pvt.Ltd</a> where we are building innovative Applications to serve the human community.
